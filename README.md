## Introduction-and-background

This repository consists of recent state-of-the-art deep learning networks for industrial machine vision application. 
The transformation of manufacturing system towards the intelligent manufacturing focuses on automation and the use of advanced technologies such as AI with robots and advanced machines for greater efficiency and precision. 
The AI system will allow for an optimized production process, smart decisions, real-time information, preventive maintenance, and self-prognosis of the production processes. With availability of big data and advanced computing equipment, and technologies, the deep learning application has been one of the highly researched areas in the scientific world in the past few years. 
Promoting this applications, this repositoty presents recent influential works related to deep learning applications on the area of anomaly detection, and other industrial machine vision applications.
